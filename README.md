## Installation
To use this project, you should have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

-- NumPy
-- Pandas
-- scikit-learn
-- Matplotlib
-- Jupyter Notebook
You can install these libraries by running the following command:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
You can also clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/AhmedNobi/Student-Score-Prediction.git
Usage
To use this machine learning model, you can open the student_score_prediction.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook. This notebook contains the code for building and training the machine learning model, as well as a detailed explanation of each step of the process.

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

Data preparation: This section loads the dataset and prepares it for training the machine learning model.
Exploratory data analysis: This section explores the dataset and visualizes the relationships between the variables.
Model training and evaluation: This section builds the machine learning model, trains it on the data, and evaluates its performance.
You can follow the instructions in each section to run the code and customize the machine learning model. You can also modify the code to use your own dataset, as long as it has the same format as the data.csv file in this repository.

Contributing
If you want to contribute to this project, you can fork this repository and make your changes in a new branch. You can then submit a pull request to have your changes reviewed and merged into the main branch.
